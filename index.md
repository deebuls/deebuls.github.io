To start with my name **"Deebul"** doesnt have a meaning. Long story short, they were
rhyming and second most important they thought they were doing something cool. 
Seriously guys, Deebul!! it rhymes with Bull, BulBul ahh . (said that love you mom dad)

> **So if there doesnt exist a meaning, I thought lets define it myself.**

Yes, so in the process of my role as a Homo Sapien, I would like to work towards
some meaningful stuff, so that when I exist stage, the audience think that the word made
some sense.(The Hyperbole intended )

#My story so far
As I liked Biology in my school, I took Engineering for my graduation.
So I am an Engineer by education and proudly by profession also.
I was so involved in **Engineering** and its branches that I just keep on gliding through them.
I did my graduation in **Electronics and Telecommunication** for 4 years, but in the Final year
I was obssesed with programming micro controllers. So I went to do **Diploma in Embedded Systems**
and learnt a lot about micro processors. Which ended up me being a Embedded Engineer. Then I got Hired in a company
where I learned all about **Computer Sciences** (crazy field of science).
After 4 years I realized that I need to learn more so I am doing **Masters in Automation**. 
And I think when I complete I will be a **Falooda Engineer**. 

Which defines my most important character, which is ____ (Yes, you gussed it right. Dont tell anyone :) ).
But as you know a man is defined by things he does in his free time.

So when I am not contributing towards my stomach.
I practise a bit of yoga and meditation (tautology). Seriously guys it works and helps a lot.
I learn a lot about  **Hindu Philosohy, Economy, Theology, Politics and Entreprenuership**.
I love languages and I am in peace with all mostly Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, English, Tamil. Also tried some Telugu and German. 
Hope to master **Sanskrit** (fingers crossed).
I am obssesed with new technologies and trends in it so I am always keenly watching you.
(Basically I am looking for the next branch of engineering I need to shift).
I am a **Linux** guy and I promise in the name of GOD I only use linux for my computing needs.

Also there are stuff which I think I can do which is even more interesting.
I think I can dance and that I am a photographer. (I also think I can sing :P )

> Finally life has thought me that the happiness is not outside but inside me.
Please do join me in my Journey inside to discover my Happiness.


This is my Truth, so subjective to my understanding. So please <del>dont</del> mind :) !

####Postscript:
Wow what a self obsessed individual so much he can talk about himself. Obviously 
my story is not a tweet I can use as much words I need. But I am telling you after 60 years when I 
will be young again this will hilarious stuff to read.
