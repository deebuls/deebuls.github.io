To start with my name **Deebul** doesnt have a meaning. Long story short, they were
rhyming and second most important they thought they were doing something cool. 
Seriously guys, Deebul!! it rhymes with Bull, BulBul ahh . (But love you mom dad)
**So I thought lets make that as the aim of my life.**
Yes, so in the process of my role of Homo Sapiens, I would like to work towards
meaningful stuff so that when I exist stage, the audience think that the word made
some sense.(The Hyperbole intended )

As I liked Biology in my School, I took Engineering for my graduation.
So I am an Engineer by education and proudly by profession also.
I was so involved in **Engineering** and its branches that I just keep on gliding through them.
I did my graduation in **Electronics and Telecommunication** for 4 years, but in the Final year
I was obssesed with programming micro controllers. So I went to do **Diploma in Embedded Systems**
and learnt a lot about micro processors. Which ended up me being a Embedded Engineer. Then I got Hired in a company
where I had to learn all about Computer Sciences and I coded for 4 years in C++(Beautiful Language).
After 4 years I realized that I need to learn more so I am doing **Masters in Automation**. 
And I think when I complete I will be a **Falooda Engineer**. 

Which defines my most important character, which is NOTHING.
Basically that defines what I do for a living. But as you know a man is defined by his hobbies.

So when I am not contributing towards my stomach.
I learn a lot about  **Hindu Philosohy, Bhagwad Gita, Economy, Theology and 
Politics**.
I am obssesed with new technologies and trends in it so I am always keenly watching you.
(Basically I am looking for the next branch of engineering I need to shift).
I am a **Linux** guy and I promise in the name of GOD I only use linux for my computing needs.

And Finally life has thought me that the knowledge is not outside but inside me.
Please do join me in my Journey inside to find my meaning of Life.


This is my Truth, so subjective to my understanding. So please dont mind!
