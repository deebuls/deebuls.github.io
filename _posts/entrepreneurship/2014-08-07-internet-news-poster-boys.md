## Internet News

The Internet has changed the way the news has been delivered to the end factors.
Most recent incident of how the Indian goverment has brought a threat to the 
existing Media houses because of the use of social media and internet to connect
directly to the masses caught my eyes.

Currently the technology required for the same is being done by bigger corporate 
houses like SAP, IBM and Salesforce. But I found that there are some inhouse
entrepreneurs in this buisness of bringing 
news to the people through the new media the Internet.
