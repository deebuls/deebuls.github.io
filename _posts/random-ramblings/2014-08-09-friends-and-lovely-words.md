## Testimonials

I never knew the meaning of the word until I used Orkut.. Hmmm Orkut old worlds.
What a time scrap book, grapewine, communities and testimonials.

Since we know that our piece of history Orkut is going to shut office this year 
September 2014. So I thought lets gather my memories(The glorifying ones!) for the future .

Its a fact that no one can understand any other person, but with Pushya you 
cant even think to try. If we look at our friendship graph for the past 10 years.
It will be most a up and down curve in the begining with gradually the ups and downs spreading wide,
with greater gaps in between. But I am very sure the peaks of all the ups and downs have same heights.

I am not wasting words on her, not because she is worthless but because she is really unexplainable and a person to experience not read.

Here's what she thought of me 10 years back (Whenever I read this I always think she loves me )

> DEEBUL – thee bull dog!Dats how v used 2 call him. Met dis creative n brainy

> Deebul is alwys der for people who needs him.They will go back wid a peace of mind and they will always have a smile on their face.i remember, Deebul help us a lot in my final year project and all thx to the great Deebul.
Now anything I say about his talent its gonna be less.
He is a complete all-rounder n..his talents and creativity extends frm Dancing, music,sports,electronics,Linux and many more things.
He is very hardworking n…alwys like to do new things.I alwys respect him for his talent.
He is Multitasker….Everytime that I have seen Deebul he’s always doing atleast two things at a time. Only great people can do that and Deebul is one among them. 
Hhmm...I m nt sure but he is slightly dreamer 1.He keeps dreaming higher and higher.Maybe its something huge for normal people like us.
Deebul is full of emotions..n..its very easy to blackmail Deebul emotionally .
Dude I wish u get everything in life !

> i know i know..i should be ashamed of myself to have written about this cool ice so late....but atleast I am writing..n I am sure he will be really glad that i finnaly did.I met him first time in our Engineering College. n…I thought a guy like him must b full of attitude but it didn't took me long to realize that how wrong I was. I came to know that I was quite lucky to have a friend like him.
Hhmm…I remember d traditional day when he had worn White Lungi. ..hahaha….I swear,tht time he were looking typical Mallu.dats why we call him as ‘Anna ‘.
I think u people very well know wat kind of person he actually is ..no hidden layers !He wants something from u he'll ask for it...no masking it under something or talking indirectly.He is coolest.His intension is always good and never hurt anyone and always tries to bring smile.
One of the greatest qualities of Deebul is that he mostly never says a no to anyone who come to him for help.Whether it is emotional support or financial.

### Jithin Valson Jacob

Yup, the casonova of Orkut. The one guy who tested and utilized all the features of 
orkut to his best use, no one else than Jithin.

Lets check his thoughts.

## Testimonials I wrote

Seems I am a bit miser here and strange to the unknown.
I have written only 2 testmonials 1 for Janhavi which is a artwork.
and second to Neenad Arul (Really strange) we were not much of a friend, but i always knew that i respected him to the core.
A person of utmost standard of living and thoughts.

Heres what I wrote for him
