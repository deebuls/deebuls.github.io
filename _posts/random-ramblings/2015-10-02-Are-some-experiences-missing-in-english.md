title: Are some expereices in english missing
categories: english, hindi
---
An random thought that "Tujhe pana ke liye itni shiddath kii .." is not same
as "I did so much hard work to get you" . i.e. "Pana" ~= Get
-----

We know that there are several expressions which doesnt have an english
translation. Or if some expresssion which translated from our regional
languages to english renders a very funny reciation.
@todo Some examples of funny ? 

But there are some very common expressions in our daily life which we have
adopted the english versions even though, the expression it wants to conceive
is not same as the one in the reginonal language.

I rest this with a simple example :
> Mujhe tumhein **panna** hain 

> I need to get you ?

Are these statements equal. Does get transfer to pana.
Why does the indian version feels good . and why does the english version
feels authoritarian?

Is the experinces with the words different? what are the thougths in the
mind..

Questions to explore.. Let me give it a  thought for now .

But I put my findings that "get " ~= "paana" .
Let me proove it with some solid proofs :) .
