On the basis of Shri Rajeev Malhotras book [Being Different](www.BeingDifferentBook.com),
chapter 5: Sanskrit, there are many words in Sanskrit hencefort संस्कृत which cannot be translated in Latin 
languages basically English. So continuing with his efforts this page tries to 
identify and add more such words which should be used as it is, since the english translation
loosess the semantics in it.

## Inspiration 

The Book [Being Different, An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism](www.beingdifferentbook.com) 
examines the differences between the Indian way of thinking to that of the western.

On of the major differences is in the languages used in the both cultures. Which the book critiques as the 

> fashionable reductive translations and argues for preserving certain non-translatable words of Sanskrit.

## Non Translatable Sanskrit Mantras by Rajiv Malhotra 

### Unique claim of Sanskrit

* Vibrations, not merely meaning; each vibration has a defined effect
* One vibration cannot be substituted for another; hence non-translatability

### Sanskrit protects dharma from digestion

* When fully translated, dharma dissolves as subset of Judeo-Christianity
* Add certain Sanskrit words into English: potential as poison pills
* Sanskrit influence on pan-Asian Sanskriti

## List of Non-Translatables

|Sanskrit Word    | Its Not equal to |
|:---|:---|
| **Brahman** | **GOD** |
| Brahman comes from root word "brih" means to expand.  The all-expansive ultimate reality that creates all, lives in all and transcends all.    | In Judaism, GOD was seen on Mount Sinai who is creator of universe| 
| BRAHMAN is the cosmos and resides in all of us, unrealized as atman  | In Judaism, GOD was seen on Mount Sinai who is creator of universe.| 
| BRAHMAN is not authoritative or punitive.   | GOD is authoritative and punishes those who transgress HIS rules and those who do not follow HIS religion. | 
| ISHWARA, BRAHMAN, DEVTA and BHAGWAN all have different meanings and contexts of use  |   They all cannot be replaced by GOD just like UNCLE does not necessarily means chacha, mama etc .| 
| **Atman** | **Soul** |
| In dharmic tradition, the true nature of self or Atman is sat-chit-ananda.| In Christianity, all humans are born as sinners due to original sin by adam&eve. Hence the true self or Soul is sinful.|
| The true nature of Atman can be realised with sadhana or adhyatma vidya |  Only through Jesus can the Soul attain salvation.|
| Atman is present in plants and animals.  Hence nature is as sacred as the self.   | Soul is NOT PRESENT in plants and animal. In Bible, GOD gave mankind dominion over plants and animals.|
| Atman reincarnates. Hence the body is cremated once atman has departed.|   Soul DOES NOT reincarnate. Hence in Christianity you get only one body that must be preserved till the 'end of time'.|
| **Dharma** | **Religion** |
| Dharma comes from Sanskrit word 'dhri' which means 'that which upholds' or 'that without which nothing can stand' or ''that which maintains stability and harmony of universe''.| Religion is worship of divine that is separate from human, has religious institution/authority and governed. Religious rituals are based on events that happened some time in history. Hence all Abrahmic religions i.e., Judaism, Christianity and Islam are history-centric.|
| Dharma is conduct, duty, justice, morality, virtue, right and much more.  Animals, Plants, Electrons have dharma but no Religion.    | No such explanation for Religion. Also, Religion is only for humans.|
| Dharma is not LAW as law is authoritative.   | Western religion believe GOD's law must be obeyed and hence non-followers must be converted or punished.|
| **Murthi**  | **Idol** | 
| Sanskrit word 'Murti' means real, awakened and expressive of divine spirit.| In Christianity, If an object is revered/respected but not worshipped is termed as 'ICON' but if elevated as divine status it is called 'IDOL'. In Orthodox Christianity, icons/images are KISSED, TOUCHED, REVERED, RESPECTED but 'technically' not worshipped.  What Christians revere are ICONS while images, murtis, devotional objects were termed IDOLS and not ICONS.|
| Prana-Pratishtha' pooja is the ritual of infusing the Murtis with prana or divine energy. Its only after prana-pratishtha pooja is offered to Murtis. |  No such thing happens with idols.|
| Visarjan is the ritual of throwing the Murti in holy water to encourage detachment from the Murti ie encourages non-attachment to Murtis.   | No such thing happens with idols|
| As per Aurobindo, it is not the stone but the divine presence/energy in the Murti to which the prayer is offered  |  |
|**Guru or Rishi or Yogi** | **Prophet or Saint** |
| Guru is one who guides individual disciple's sadhana.| Saint is one who is dead now and church recognized him enjoying the bliss as promised in Christianity.|
| Yogis and Rishis devote their lives to attain highest level of consciousness.  | Prophet is chosen by GOD to communicate with humans.|
|**Moksha**|**Salvation**|
|**Karma**|**Suffereings**|
|**Yajna**|**Sacrifice**|
|**Devata**|**GOD or Pagan God**|
|**Kundalini or Shakti**|**Holy Spirit**|
|**Jati or Varna**|**Cast**|
