On the basis of Shri Rajeev Malhotras book [Being Different](www.BeingDifferentBook.com),
chapter 5: Sanskrit, there are many words in Sanskrit which cannot be translated in Latin 
languages basically English. So continuing with his efforts this page tries to 
identify and add more such words which should be used as it is, since the english translation
loosess the semantics in it.

## Inspiration 

The Book [Being Different, An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism](www.beingdifferentbook.com) 
examines the differences between the Indian way of thinking to that of the western.

On of the major differences is in the languages used in the both cultures. Which the book critiques as the 

> fashionable reductive translations and argues for preserving certain non-translatable words of Sanskrit.

## Non Translatable Sanskrit Mantras by Rajiv Malhotra 

### Unique claim of Sanskrit

* Vibrations, not merely meaning; each vibration has a defined effect
* One vibration cannot be substituted for another; hence non-translatability

### Sanskrit protects dharma from digestion

* When fully translated, dharma dissolves as subset of Judeo-Christianity
* Add certain Sanskrit words into English: potential as poison pills
* Sanskrit influence on pan-Asian Sanskriti
